 Rationale for Task Assignment:

During our meetings, we defined the requirements, and each group member selected the requirement from the dashboard that best suited their skills and interests. In order to ensure an equal distribution of workload, we assigned multiple participants to some sections. Therefore, even though each person is responsible for a specific phase, the tasks within each phase involve multiple participants.
